## **Inspiration**
We saw the challenge and we thought it would be interesting to do. We also liked the idea of a user friendly GUI. Blueprints seemed to fit the theme of the prompt, so we encorperated that into the design.

## **What it does**
Our project takes in the input given in the prompt, and outputs the best possible solution. 

## **How we built it**
We first started by writing the algorithm to solve the problem and drawing out artwork. Then we put it all together in pygame.

## **Challenges we ran into**
We found out some of the python modules do not work well together. We also discovered pygame was probably not the best solution to our problem.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We are proud of how our algorithm works since it finds the mathematicllay best way to organize the teams every time.

## **What we learned**
We learned a lot more about binning algorithms and pygame.

## **What's next for SquirrelSpace**
We want to expand this to do more for workspaces. We want SquirrelSpace to help more people.
